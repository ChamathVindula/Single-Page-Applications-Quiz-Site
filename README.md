# Single-Page-Applications-Quiz-Site
A project that I had done for a web application development unit I had done in my Computer Science Bachelor. This website contains both front end and back end functionality. Unfortunately this web site consists of PHP code which will not execute on github pages so I cannot launch this site. But the entire codebase is available.

What I have learnt from this Project:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* SQL (Through PHP's inbuilt mysqli entension)
